# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

## Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment retail customers into distinct behavioral groups. Using K-Means clustering, the analysis identifies customer personas based on annual income and spending behavior to support data-driven marketing and retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset contains demographic and transactional information for retail customers, including:
- Annual income
- Spending score
- Customer identifiers

Dataset included for reproducibility.


## Methodology
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior patterns
- Applied feature scaling to prepare data for clustering
- Trained a K-Means clustering model to segment customers
- Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
- Evaluated cluster separation and interpretability
- Visualized customer segments using scatter plots and centroid analysis

## Results
- Identified five distinct customer segments with meaningful differences in spending and income behavior
- Visualizations revealed clear behavioral patterns that can support targeted marketing, retention, and acquisition decisions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Takeaways
This project demonstrates the application of unsupervised learning to real-world customer data, emphasizing data preprocessing, model evaluation, and the translation of analytical results into actionable business insights.
